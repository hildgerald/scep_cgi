# scep_cgi

# INTRODUCTION
This program was adapted from the software that you find here : https://github.com/yiyuanzhong/scep. He created a server so I need to work with a lot of PKI, PKI hierarchical, etc... So I only adapt the functionalities to be a CGI software and not only a server so a CGI program is the best option. I only add the software with his directory and certificates and you have a scep server with easy configuration...
I add the hierarchical PKI and RA could be on an other branch than the CA signer. My software add every extensions from the CSR during the enrollment.

You use this software with your own responsability. It's only a test software without any cyber security function (because I need to do some cyber test of a scep client).
